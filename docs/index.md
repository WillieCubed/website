# Design Tidbits

## General Philosophy

I wanted a website that reflected the quirks and idiosyncrasies of my own
personality while still maintaining a high degree of accessibility of
information.

The themes can be described as:

- Expressiveness: portraying my personal brand as an extension of my
  personality, not a cookie cutter website with minimum effort
- Utility: having enough information for a variety of purposes
- Brevity: (something I generally struggle with) providing enough information to
  discover something, and not much more by default

During the design of this website, I faced several roadblocks.

I see this website as a living, working representation of my work.

## Inspiration

I wanted something bold. I wanted something useful. I wanted something that was
_mine_ and not merely an imitation of someone else more notable than myself.

The general _vibe_ of my website can be described as neubrutalist.

This website takes inspiration primarily from DeepMind's [website][deepmind] and
also from [Morag][morag] Myerscough's design style.

Despite my intention to build a cool website, I recognized that I, an aspiring
academic, could not pull off a MrBeast-style website without risking being taken
less-than-seriously. After all, if actually world-renowned professors could get
by with websites that look like they were designed in the early 1990s, then why
risk alientating website visitors?

I decided to just be myself while risking that some day, someone would actually
look for this thing and maybe have second thoughts about my style of doing
things.

In implementation of the website, I take advantage of the fact that most people
who visit won't browse around. As such, I designed many of the pages in
isolation to provide an optimized experience for each. For example, the projects
page exists as a destination in and of itself which has a different purpose than
my about page.
