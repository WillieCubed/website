# Overview

I divide my projects into one of three categories:

|                 | Personal Project                                              | WillieCubed Ventures                                                                       | Affiliated Projects                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Usage**       | For exclusively personal use                                  | Originally meant for my own personal use but primarily developed for an external user base | Developed primarily under or with another group or organization                         |
| **Development** | Exclusively conceptualized and engineered by me               | Primarily developed or maintained by myself                                                | Conceptualized and/or engineered with others with substantial contributions from myself |
| **Domain**      | Always has web domain in the form of <project>.williecubed.me | Usually has a dedicated domain, and <project-id>.williecubed.me may redirect to it.        | Always has another primary external domain                                              |
| **Example**     | Personal website, song2sheet                                  | LogDate, Yearbook, Orbit                                                                   | HackPortal, Concept Learning Project                                                    |

In all cases, <project-id>.williecubed.dev will always redirect to a given project's website.
