# Overview

ParliPro is an interactive tool to conduct meetings using Robert's Rules of
Order in realtime.

With ParliPro, meeting organizers can keep order during a meeting and ensure
that everyone, including an audience, knows what is happening at all times.

# Motivation

[Robert's Rules of Order](https://robertsrules.com/) (Newly Revised) is a system
of parlimentary procedure used by many deliberative bodies throughout the United
States. It is often used by student governments (and often fraternities and
sororities) to govern the rules in meetings and of its members. As the secretary
(and de jure parlimentarian) for the [Student Senate](https://sg.utdallas.edu)
at The University of Texas at Dallas, I learned a great deal about how to run
meetings. I also learned how annoying and messy meetings could get if people
did not understand what was going on.

Although the Robert's Rules framework is flexible and appropriate for the
legislative body of a student government, its verbose and opinionated nature
often confuses freshman and even veteran senators. We would often spend 20
minutes (in a two-hour meeting, mind you) debating and clarifying parlimentary
procedure of a motion because someone misunderstood what was said or simply
wasn't paying attention.

During the 2022-2023 Senate term, I wanted to use my web development skills
to create a tool for running modern meetings subject to the constraints of
parlimentary procedure. I designed and built ParliPro instead of doing homework
because I was bored one week and kept having nightmares (/s) about people not
understanding Robert's Rules and feeling embarassed that my student government
couldn't efficiently run meetings.

While this tool was never used in production due to a lack of buy-in from our
student government's leadership, I point to it as an example of my approach to
building software that's not only idealistic but also practical.

# Features

## Current Motion Companion View

For meetings that use an overhead projector, the chairperson or parlimentarian
can open a full screen companion view in a web browser that the parlimentarian
can update in realtime.

## Meeting Links and Archives

Meeting participants can follow along using meeting links generated by the chair
or parlimentarian. Records for these meetings can be viewed publicly even after the
meeting concludes.

## Exporting motions

Meeting organizers can export a list of all motions after a meeting from the
chairperson view to a plain text file, useful for preparing the official
minutes.
